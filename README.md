# dataPaginationFiltering
In this project, I used a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page. 

Started with a file that contained information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Using Vanilla JavaScript skills I displayed the first nine students on the page. Then added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

## Code Example
```javascript
    let btns = linkList.querySelectorAll('BUTTON');
      if( btns.length > 0) {
         btns[0].classList.add('active');
      };
```
